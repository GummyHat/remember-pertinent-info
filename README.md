# **Remember Pertinent Information**

## Vision:

Our vision is to produce a web app that will help facilitate the learning of various topics. This will be done via modules and other systems that will allow educators to set their students up for success. The platform should be easy for professors to utilize, and will allow the professors to post content which will help students familiarize themselves with course materials, or brush up on course content and gauge their preparedness on prerequisites.

## Stack:

* HTML  
* CSS/Tailwind  
* React/TS  
* MongoDB?  
* PostgreSQL

## Semester Specific Goals:

Our first step is to  analyze and interface with the Course Scaffold website from a previous RCOS project. It is defunct, and if we can get it up and running we could potentially utilize it as a baseline user interface tool and database to build our project from.

If we are unable to get a working version of the Course Scaffold website, our next step will be to build our own course framework and user interface. 

The next step once we have created a functional course framework with a user interface is to allow for user posts, such as quizzes, videos, and text-based posts.

Finally, we will ensure that our database accurately and dynamically reflects RPI course offerings, and work on polishing the look of the project to be appealing to users. We will reach out to professors and encourage them to utilize the resource, additionally seeking end user feedback from their experiences to improve the project.

## Milestones:

### September:

* Recover any code and data from the previous project  
* Repair any code found to create a basic starting point

### October:

* Produce a functional backend that can retrieve information from RPIâ€™s already existing databases  
* Create a database to store out course clusters and other application-specific data  
* Create a home page to allow users to find uploaded content

### November:

* Enable some sort of sign-in/verification method for teachers/students (use duo?)  
* Allow professors to produce their own content

### December:

* Produce a means for professors to create and upload interactive content (implementation of modules)  
* Outreach, try to get users to create content for the site/students.
